# AudioFlare

DESCRIPTION:
AudioFlare is an audio vizualizer that provides an artistic representation of any audio input in your browser!

NOTES: 
- AudioFlare only takes input from your default mic, however if you wish to visualize your audio output (listening to music, movies, podcasts, etc) there are ways to loop your output back to an input: (This was the intended use)
    1. If you have realtek audio drivers, navigate to your control panel sound configuration and go to the recording panel. Right click on        the panel and check "Show Disabled Divices" and "Show Disconnected Devices". Then right click on "Stereo Mix" and set it as your          default device and default communication device.
    2. If you have Creative Sound Blaster, then follow the steps in #1, but instead of "stereo mix" it will be called "what you hear".
    
- AudioFlare.html runs the source code from online links. If you wish to have a local copy, you will need to download the source from the html and replace the online links with local adresses.

AudioFlare was created with Processing javascript and the p5.js sound library. p5.js webpage: https://p5js.org/
